  An implementation of the example [using GPT-3 to summarize proposed legislation, described by Nick Diakopoulos](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rr0dxKpwK5zjch1V4eKjwwyVW-AzuDTw#scrollTo=zI4zN4RMg8yq). Use with care as it may introduce factual errors, hallucinations, and other artifacts in summaries.
  
  
  Note that this plugin uses *1 credit per 450 documents analyzed*, rounded up.
  Give this a full prompt that you would pass into GPT-3 and it will run it
  against your selected documents, one at a time. The Add-On only looks at the 10,000 characters of a document. 
  The prompt refers to the user input as the "Assignment," the document's text
  as "Document Text", and GPT-3's generated response as the "Answer," which can
  be helpful when defining your prompt.
